# Holochain Wiki Exercise

> Rust version/channel: stable

> HDK version: [0.0.101](https://docs.rs/hdk/0.0.101/hdk/)

Up to the challenge of defining a basic permissioned wiki in Holochain? Try to get the tests passing!

```bash
./run-test.sh
```

or open it up in VScode and open src/lib.rs and run the tests there.
